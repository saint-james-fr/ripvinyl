# Rip Vinyl


## Summary
This is a Rails app for a single user  - which I made for my girlfriend, so it's been thought in terms of DB schema for one user/one collection... 
It allows you to fetch your Discogs Collection and communicate with Discogs API.

You can mark some records as "ripped" and it stays in sync with your collection on Discogs.
You can also sort by styles and scroll them more easily.


## Installation
If you wanna clone or fork it, you'll need Env/Credentials for Active Record Encryption, Cloudinary and of course Discogs key and secret from them.
