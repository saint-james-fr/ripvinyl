# Rip Vinyl

This is an app for a single user (otherwise you may encouter some issues...), allowing you to fetch your Discogs Collection and communicate with Discogs API.
You can mark some records as "ripped" and it stays in sync with your collection on Discogs.

If you use it you'll need Env/Credentials for Active Record Encryption, Cloudinary and of course Discogs key and secret from them.

Huge thanks to buntine and his Discogs Wrapper
